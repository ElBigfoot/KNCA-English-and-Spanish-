## Temas de Arquitectura Cloud Nativa (Spanish) - Cloud Native Architecture Topics (English)

Here's a list of cloud native architecture topics translated from Spanish to English:

* **Arquitectura de Microservicios (Microservices Architecture):**  This is the foundational concept of cloud native architecture. Applications are built as small, independent services that communicate with each other via APIs. 
* **Contenedores (Containers):**  Standardized units of software that package code and its dependencies together. Popular containerization technologies include Docker and Kubernetes.
* **Orquestación de Contenedores (Container Orchestration):**  The process of automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Kubernetes is a leading container orchestration platform.
* **Funciones Serverless (Serverless Functions):**  An execution model where cloud providers handle server provisioning and management. Developers write code (functions) that trigger in response to events.
* **API Gateways (API Gateways):**  A single entry point for APIs that provides functionalities like authentication, authorization, and traffic management.
* **Infraestructura Inmutable (Immutable Infrastructure):**  Infrastructure (servers, configurations) is treated as code and recreated from scratch on deployments, ensuring consistency and avoiding manual configuration drift.
* **Pruebas Continuas e Integración Continua (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery - CI/CD):** Automating the software build, testing, and deployment pipeline to deliver changes faster and more reliably.
* **Registro de Servicios (Service Discovery):**  A mechanism that allows services to find each other dynamically at runtime.
* **Configuración Dinámica (Dynamic Configuration):**  Managing application configurations externally using tools like Consul or Vault, allowing for updates without restarting services.
* **Monitoreo y Registro (Monitoring and Logging):**  Continuously collecting and analyzing application and infrastructure metrics for performance and health insights.

Además de estos temas centrales, otras áreas importantes de la arquitectura cloud nativa incluyen:

* **Mallas de Servicios (Service Meshes):**  Provide functionalities like service discovery, load balancing, and security for microservices communication.
* **Patrones de Diseño (Design Patterns):** Reusable solutions for common cloud native architecture challenges.
* **Arquitectura Reactiva (Reactive Architecture):**  An approach to building applications that are responsive, resilient, and scalable.

I hope this translation helps! Let me know if you have any other questions about cloud native architecture or related topics.
